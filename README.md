Data visualization with Divvy Data

### Installation

1. Install [Bower](http://bower.io/)
2. run `bower install`

### Data Inspirations

I happened to see this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gKN2Hq0-PxmMFBqg9e-xnwpRRh0GnmTVRQG3fjTxnT8/edit) after I bought a [Divvy](https://divvybikes.com/) membership, so I decided to do something around with Divvy's API.

Here I am using the real-time data from Divvy official endpoint <http://divvybikes.com/stations/json>
